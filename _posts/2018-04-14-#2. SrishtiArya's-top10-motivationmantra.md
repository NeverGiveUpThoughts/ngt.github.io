<h1>1. What is the toughest situation you faced and how you have overcome?</h1>
<p>A lot of are born dancer, I haven’t really been a born dancer. I just enjoyed dancing, I was not professional trained, I was not from a dance industry, not did I had a dance background, and not many of my friends were dancers. I just enjoyed dancing, so I decided that I am going to go ahead and start a venture which is related to dance. I think the most difficult thing for me was to jump, to dive into it the hell first without knowledge, there was no certainty of anything happening, and I just had to do it because I loved it. Then I started my venture, but there were struggles like financial issues, mindsets of people which were challenging. There were my own doubts and fears. There was No technical or any solid base of training as I was not a professional dancer. So to I think to figure out things and fight with people’s mindset, rigid mindset, resistance of people like “wo kese karegi?” shows kiye hai, etc. They have done so much in life, who you will going to be compete with them. I said, I don’t want to compete with them. My motive to start “Happy Dancing Feet” was to spread the joy, and that was the motive than whatever struggle you get, you will get the strength to beat the struggle because you don’t have the motive to be commercially very good. It’s about just spread joy and happiness and things just started falling in place, that’s how I started overcoming struggles with faith. </p>

<h1>2. Where does your passion come from?</h1>
<p>I think dance is a universal language. It is a feeling of expression, for me personally, dance is really let power to me. So if I feel happy or I am sad, it is a medium for me to express without anyone around judging. When I dance, I can’t think of worries, I can’t think of work, I can’t think of any stress. So for me, that is the place where passion comes from. It is that medium for me that can help me to Be Who I AM.</p>

<h1>3. You inspire millions every day "How do you stay inspire yourself"?</h1>
<p>If you look around, there is an inspiration everywhere, sometimes, I listen to a song and I hear a particular line and I think that this is what I was looking for!! Then I read a book and I read a particular line and I think I needed this in my life right now. So, if you are looking around, a small child, your own parents, a song, a line, nature. Anything could be your inspiration. You don’t need to constantly look at people who made it big. Small things around you can be your everyday inspiration. So for me, to be really inspired, I think I go back to where I came from. Why I started.  Every time I get de-motivated I go back to my roots and why began? And that what’s keeps me inspired. </p>

<h1>4. One best proud moment of your life?</h1>
<p>We did a recent project which was allegiant luxury wedding, which was for very big people from the industry. So for me that was a very big project to crack, because I went up against very big names from dance industry. Some very respectable people but still to have cracked the project and to get the project was one of my biggest achievement because I struck to my values, I struck to my ethics, I struck to what I believed in and the client really understood and felt that. And we went ahead. And to see the smiles on my parent’s faces once the show finished, they were so proud of me. So we had big celebrities, top known Bollywood celebrities performing in that show. I never imagined that something like that would come to me so early in my career. So that was a proud moment for me. <p>

<h1>5. Which person or personality do u admire the most?</h1>
<p>So for me, personally I think my sister. She is a biggest inspiration. Yes, there are amazing dancers out there and amazing people and the Prime minister and the people who are doing a great thing. For me the example right at home that really matters. As I can see them on every day basis. I can see what they do. What I hear from other people about celebrities is only me hearing. But this is me actually watching. So my sister is my role model. Mainly, because how true she is to herself!!. She is so authentic. Even in the most dreadful situation, in the most adverse and difficult situations she does the right thing. She plays an ethical role. So for me to have that courage to see her to have courage really inspires me. And I really look up to her. </p>

<h1>6. What is one characteristic that you believe every leader should possess?</h1>
<p>I think to be able to see and believe before you actually see it. So, when something is happening and if you don’t have faith and believe that the thing can happen than it’s very difficult to make them happen. So I think, every leader needs to have that faith and the foresight to believe before the thing actually comes to them. So that is one characteristic.</p>

<h1>7. What one word best sums up you and your vision?</h1>
<p>The one word that really sums up “Happy Dancing Feet” is me and my vision is JOY!!.  Because there is such lack of it right now in the world that everyone is so focused on the negativities, inhuman behavior or all of that kind of is happening. That is the reality and I can’t ignore that. But within that reality, in midst of reality if you are able to give a spark of joy to people, I think it’s makes a big difference and that’s why that’s the mission of “Happy Dancing Feet”.</p>

<h1>8. How can individual keep up their motivational level?</h1>
<p>There is so much going around in this world that you can’t do this, you can’t be this or you can’t see this. So if you have to stay motivated its needs to come from within you. If you love yourself, if you believe in yourself, if you know what matter anyone says because there will always going to be someone who is unhappy. There will going to be someone who is not agreeing with you and your emotions. But if you are convinced and you know you are right and you go ahead and you do that. I think that’s way you get motivated over the time. Whatever is your inspiration, you may look it for outside but ultimately it is all consolidated and coming from within you. And it is not coming because that person said something or this person said something. So, keep it within you and let it come from you. I think that thing can keep you motivated.</p>

<h1>9. What and whom do you love best?</h1>
<p>I think each and every person struggling with themselves and coming out of it. That is a big thing for me, as I personally have been extremely overweighting my life. I have dealt with criticism; I have dealt with lots of negativity from people. But coming through that journey has made me love myself so much more. So, for everyone, whether you are facing home issues, parental pressures, peer pressure, body image issues, awkwardness, any social issues, any phobias I know that there is way to come out it, if you want to. That is only if start loving yourself. </p>

<h1>10. One message to your all followers which you want to give?</h1>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I am not a trained dancer, and I have not done years of training. I came up with this because I enjoyed dancing. But I am majorly self-taught, whether it’s from YouTube, meeting new people, workshops, short courses. I think if you are committed to your vision and on what you want to do, you can go places. You don’t have to invest extreme amount of money and all extra unnecessary things which people say you don’t require that. You need that one thought, one wish to do it. And I think staying committed is something what I want to tell everyone. It’s like having a bath, you bath every day, and you brush your teeth. So, why not you commit to your vision every day?  Even if you miss it out on one day, you don’t feel great when you don’t take bath. Same thing as your vision, you need to follow up, you need to be committed, and you need to do it every single day of your life. That’s the message I want to give everyone. </p>
